# These are some of my favorite Impulse Responses / IR collections freely available
#### There are some rather rare / obscure collections included, that are barely known. I'm particularly fond of impulses that capture real indoor and outdoor locations, as well as classic analog hardware (eg plate reverbs)... work in progress! If you have any question simply forward an [issue report](https://github.com/IsaakCode/freeaudio/issues)

Please support the providers of these great gems by buying their commercial products! List compiled and curated by Isaak M. aka Synthiemental
